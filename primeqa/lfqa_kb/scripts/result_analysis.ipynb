      "gold: A karat in terms of gold is not the same measure as a carat of diamond weight. A carat of diamond weight is equivalent to 0.2g. Many other stones are also measured in carats, but due to varying densities, a carat of sapphire is physically smaller than a carat of diamond. Karat in gold terms is a measure of purity. Because it is measured as 24 times the purity by mass, 24k gold is pure (well, 99.9% pure) gold. 18k gold is 75% pure gold. 12k gold is 50%, and so on. The markings on the inside of a piece of jewelery may indicate the purity of the material. 24k is marked 999. 10k is marked 417. (99.9% and 41.7% respectively.)\n",

As far as the great respect people have for the founders, I think this comes from how they proposed a completely different governmental system that had never existed before. Before then, most governments were ruled by kings, dictators, oligarchies, theocracies, etc... The founders devised a system of self governance, in that the people are the ones in control of the government, and not a ruler chosen by birth, God, or a select few. The founders took great care in crafting the constitution, in that they intended the federal government to be very limited in scope, with only a few responsibilities, while implementing checks and balances to keep the three branches in check. As to why some politicians glorify the works of the founding fathers, I think they're just trying to appeal to the emotions of their constituency, as well as trying to say, \"Hey, I agree with these geniuses!

That's why marriage equality was important a few years ago. If someone was with their partner for 15 years and then suddenly dropped dead, their partner had better hope their in-laws liked them or even supported the partnership in the first place. If not, the parents could just take the house and all the money (provided the person didn't have a will). There are probably other benefits, but I think this is one of the big ones.\n",

He learned Coptic and Greek so he could translate what the Egyptian meant in Greek. Greek and Latin were still widely spoken, so that made translation a lot easier. Translating the Heiroglyphics meant just connecting the Demotic sounds to the Heiroglyphic words.\n",

What generates the forward momentum is the sideways lift being created by the aerofoil shape of the sail.

The sail speed record is currently held by [Sailrocket 2]( URL_0 ) which can sail at about 75 mph in 29 mph winds. This is possible because rather than just being blown along, the boat is powered by the lift its sail generates. Sailing boats can only sail so close to the direction the wind is coming from though. Any closer than about 45 degrees from the wind (less for high tech race yachts) and the sails will stall, stopping the boat in the water.

      "gold: The right joy-con of a Nintendo Switch has a shiny black sensor at the bottom. This sensor, when you point it at stuff, can sense the shape and distance of the stuff. Sort of like a Kinect, if you’ve ever used one of those. Piano: When you slide the right joy-con into the cardboard piano, then pressing keys down on the piano makes other things inside the piano move. The joy-con senses what those things are and, judging by the shapes and positions, the Switch is able to tell which keys are being pressed. The Switch then plays notes that go with those keys, so pressing a cardboard key makes the Switch play the note for that key. The piano is small so it won’t have as many keys as a real piano, but it’s a neat start. RC car: Both joy-cons have a rumble feature, meaning that they can vibrate. Most video game controllers have rumble features now. Most games usually use it to make the controller shake when your guy in the game gets hit, which makes it feel more real. With Labo, you attach the joy-cons to the cardboard RC car and then you press the Switch touchscreen which has touchscreen buttons for left and right. If you press the “left” touchscreen button, the joy-con on the right will shake and that’ll make the car turn left. The RC car won’t have wheels and so it’ll need to be on a flat surface to work. Will it work on carpet? I dunno, I guess we’ll find out.\n",

      "gold: Food studies scholar here. It mainly depends on where culture stands at the time. If people think that certain things are clean and that health is defined a certain way, then dietary advice will follow. Take bread for example: brown bread used to be considered the stuff peasants ate and it wasn't healthful. In the middle of the 20th century, people thought that white foods were cleaner and therefore healthier. Now, white bread, white rice, and white sugar have been abandoned in favor of brown bread, brown rice, and raw sugar. Peasant foods are now good for you. New science also changes things. As we learn more about how the human body works, we can better judge how food affects the body. Brown fat, for example, did not exist in the imagination in the 19th century, when moderation and bland foods were put forth as better for the body. There are also powerful lobbyists who make their case. Using scientific studies (that they may or may not have funded) they petition to shape how we think about food at the level of public policy. This scholar has a lot to say about the matter:  URL_0 .

Also the lyrics consist of everything; they are typically more fictitious or political though. Thrash metal: take it up a notch from Heavy metal. The guitars are heavier, faster, more distorted and sometimes more technical. Again, the vocalists are intense, however, they have more of a growly way of singing, but they're still fairly clean and easy to understand. The lyrical content is often political or controversial in some way. (Jihad by Slayer, Laid to Rest by Lamb of God, Holy Wars... The Punishment is Due by Megadeth) Black metal (from my understanding): A bit slower than Thrash, but more distorted. The vocals are normally squealing and growling in a way that isn't very easy to understand. Lyrical content as far as I know can be fairly Satanic, morbid and dark. Death metal (again, from my understanding): it's like Black metal and Thrash metal had a love child. It has the intensity, and speed of Thrash but the vocals are similar to Black metal. I believe the lyrical content is the same or similar as Black metal as well. Source: I've been a metalhead for 9 going on 10 years. However, I'm more into Thrash, Classic/Heavy Metal and Metalcore. So the last two may be totally out of wack. Feel free to correct me!\n",

That one degree means a lot more ice melts, a lot more water evaporates, and increasing pressures cause higher winds. That's part of the reason why calling it \"Climate Change\" has started to replace \"Global Warming\", even though the overall trend would still be warming. It's because these small shifts of 1 degree could vastly effect local climates. A farmland could become a desert, for instance, or a dry area could start to experience severe storms and floods, or prevailing winds and ocean currents could change direction, leading to certain places becoming much colder. But the real worry is that it can have a snowball effect. That 1 degree of temperature can do stuff like melt permafrost or increase ocean acidification, and sometimes release trapped sources of CO2 or Methane, further increasing the greenhouse effect. So just because we increase it by 1 degree, it doesn't mean the change will stay at 1 degree.\n",

There are many different types of neurons, and each type of neuron has a different role in the brain.  The most common type of neurotransmitter is serotonin, which is responsible for mood regulation.  When you take antidepressants, the brain releases a chemical called serotonin, and it makes the neurons firing faster.  This makes the brain more active, and makes the neurotransmitter more available for the brain to use.  \n",

      "Now, the reason why this is important is that it makes it easier for the body to process information.  If you have a depressed brain, the neurotransmitters that make you feel happy are not being used as much, and the brain doesn't have the same amount of serotonin to process it.  So, when you take an antidepressant, the serotonin in the body is being used more, and more efficiently.  That means that the neurotransmotor cortex is being stimulated, and that the neurons are firing faster, and so the brain can process more information.\n",

      "--\n",
      "gold: Cats have some nuances in their behaviour that a lot of humans tend to overlook or misinterpret as lack of affection or being aloof. One thing that a cat will do to display that they are comfortable around you, is look away from you. This lets you know that they do not perceive you as a threat. This is often accompanied by a slow blink where they half close their eyes. If you reciprocate that slow blink and slightly turn your head away, it will show them that you feel the same. If you pick a cat up or approach it in a manner that is very direct, they can interpret this as threatening behaviour. Some cats like to be picked up, some don't. That's kind of dependent on how they were raised. I have a kitten that I'm fostering, and he will come over which I call him with a particular sound or if I make eye-contact and slow-blink. The problem is that a lot of people try to interpret cats in the same way as dogs. Dogs operate a lot like humans in their social structure, which is why we get along so well. For cats, we need to learn to adapt to how they socialise, because our methods do not have as much in common. So, to address your initial question: A cat is more affectionate when you are ignoring them, because they perceive you as less threatening and see you as being more comfortable with them.\n",

Barbarossa was not the \"start\" of he war for Germany. It was the beginning, middle, and end. They didn't really have the resources to fight beyond that and when Barbarossa failed to topple the Soviet Government, the Germans were doomed. If the Germans knew how strong the Russians really were, they never would have invaded (though they'd still be in a perilous position because every year the Russians would increase their advantage and eventually use that to invade Germany).

      "--\n",
      "gold: I can't exactly explain the science behind night terrors, but I can recount the experience of having them as a very young child. The one that is most memorable happened when I was around 4 or 5 years old. My bed faced a window and it was often the source of strange shadows and lights that scared me before bed. When this particular night terror began I was first jolted awake with a very bright light shining through the window. My eyes opened wide and something like a \"ghost witch\" appeared to be flying towards me through the window. There was loud noises like thunder behind her. I turned away to flee and realized my arms and legs wouldn't move. The feeling you get when a limb falls asleep; that's how my entire body felt. The most intense sense of my limbs having fallen asleep. When I looked at my hands I noticed there were shackles pinning me to the bed. Except they were bright, like electricity. It was as if they were shocking me and that was the feeling in my limbs. I turned back to the window and the witch was now only feet away from me. She was staring right at me and was very bright. I felt like I was going to die. She opened her mouth and let out the most ear piercing screech I have ever heard in my life. I screamed in response and closed my eyes. Moments later my parents rushed in my room. There were other ones I remember. This was the worst and most memorable. It was over 30 years ago, but I remember it vividly. They are truly terrifying. I could not imagine living with them as an adult. Your entire body just goes into overdrive. Everything was bright, loud, painful and I felt like I was going to die the entire time. My understanding is that part of night terrors are accelerated heart beat, pupil dilation, sweating and fear. I don't know if that's what causes everything to be so bright and loud or if your mind is just perceiving these dreams as real and responds to them physically. Sadly, my daughter suffered from them as well. She had bad sleepwalking as well, which I understand to be a related disorder. edit: can't spell\n",

      "--\n",
      "gold: So before the Europeans arrived Rwandan and Burundian society had a hierarchy with Tutsis at the top and Hutus and the twa at the bottom there was no clear racial distinction because most Rwandans have the same features and the system was primarily economic with the those who were rich considered Tutsis and those without considered Hutus. Then the Belgians came and colonized the region and they saw the hierarchical system as a way to effectively control the people. In doing so they added a racial dynamic in which those with lighter skin,narrow noses and tall height were considered Tutsi while those who had more negroid features were considered Hutu or twa. The Tutsis who ran Rwanda weren't very nice to the Hutus and this sowed the hatred and resentment for the Tutsis amongst Hutus. This changed with the wave of African independence movements which made the Tutsis demand independence(because being upper class they were more educated and were more exposed to pan Africanist ideas spreading at the time).This resulted in Belgium switching its support to the Hutus because with Tutsi leaders pushing for independence there was a fear that Rwanda would become communist and Hutus were seen as easier to control. Eventually the Hutus would overthrow the Tutsi monarchy in Rwanda which was then followed by a purge of Tutsi leading many into exile and installing a hardline regime that ruled until it was overthrown in 1994, by The Rwandan patriotic front led by Tutsi exiles based and supported by Uganda.\n",

It starts by building factories that produce greenhouse gases, like we've done on Earth. Probably gases like Nitrous Oxide, which have a greenhouse warming effect 300 times greater than CO2, Methane (23x stronger than CO2), and Ammonia. Issues with the magnetosphere can be solved with new technology in materials, protecting organisms from radiation.

You can prove the set has a finite number of elements, and you can show that the sets are finite.  If you have an infinite number of sets, you could prove that there's a finite amount of elements in the set.  So you can say that the number of integers in the sets is the number that the universe is made up of.  That's the axiom.

As far as the great respect people have for the founders, I think this comes from how they proposed a completely different governmental system that had never existed before. Before then, most governments were ruled by kings, dictators, oligarchies, theocracies, etc... The founders devised a system of self governance, in that the people are the ones in control of the government, and not a ruler chosen by birth, God, or a select few. The founders took great care in crafting the constitution, in that they intended the federal government to be very limited in scope, with only a few responsibilities, while implementing checks and balances to keep the three branches in check. As to why some politicians glorify the works of the founding fathers, I think they're just trying to appeal to the emotions of their constituency, as well as trying to say, \"Hey, I agree with these geniuses!

So that's not a very appealing option to me. But if your solar panels are 15% efficient, then I can spend significantly less money only covering half of my roof with panels, and still get way more electricity than my entire roof would've made with 1% efficient panels.

Military drones are often used in counter-insurgency/counter-terror operations, where the enemy is out of uniform and surrounded by non-combatants. People claim that drones have injured or killed civilians during these missions. Collateral damage is always bad press, not to mention that these are essentially assassination missions. Domestic use of drones for surveillance and pursuit is controversial as well, which seems to be mostly based on a lack of trust in police using them ethically. There is also the possibility of using them to expose and persecute people for \"morality\" crimes, such as homosexuality or failure to uphold religious mandates. tldr; People are pissed about drones because they don't trust the people using them.\n",

That's why marriage equality was important a few years ago. If someone was with their partner for 15 years and then suddenly dropped dead, their partner had better hope their in-laws liked them or even supported the partnership in the first place. If not, the parents could just take the house and all the money (provided the person didn't have a will). There are probably other benefits, but I think this is one of the big ones.\n",

The yellow colors mean that the air is more dense while the pink colors mean that it is less dense. The more dense the air is, the colder it is. You can also tell from that picture which way the wind is blowing overall in the atmosphere. It blows along those black lines and from west to east. As you can see the wind goes strongly from north to south in the west and carries cold air with it. Then it goes from south to north, doing the opposite. On top of this, there is a cycle that happens to the water in the Pacific Ocean between South America and Indonesia called ENSO. Sometimes, the surface water is warmer in the west and sometimes further east. Right now the warm water is further east towards South America. This cycle effects the weather around the world, as shown by [this picture]( URL_0 ). As you can see, it makes the NE warmer than usual and makes the south a bit wetter (e.g. snowier). One thing we CANNOT say here is that climate change is at fault. This event is too short of a time scale to be considered climate. We would have to average over several decades. While climate change is happening, this is a case of some crazy weather. (Edit: Feel free to ask questions, whether to dumb this down or expand on it. This stuff is cool. I study it.)\n",

As much as you'd like to, you can't release it all over the world at the same time. It's impossible for a number of reasons: * There are probably 50,000+ movie theaters around the world that will show the film, but you only printed 3,000 copies of the film (because film is expensive to print and even more expensive to store and transport) * The stars of your movie need to promote it--interviews, autograph sessions and whatnot--and they can't be on 4 different continents at once. * Your movie has to be localized--translated, dubbed or subbed, edited for content to fit with local laws and so on--and that takes time. * There are other big events or movies occurring at different times around the world, and you don't want your movie to have to compete for viewers' attention--or you want to take advantage of a national holiday--so you pick the best release dates you can for each region. Bottom line, it might take as long as nine months for your film to complete its theatrical release cycle around the world. So your film releases in March in the US. By May, theaters in the US have stopped showing it, so you get ready to release it on DVD in July, while it's still relatively fresh in people's minds. But in South Africa, it won't hit theaters until December. How do you stop South Africans from importing the DVD from the US, instead of waiting until December to watch the movie in theaters there? Region codes. There's also regional pricing differences to consider. In America, where everyone is fat and happy, people can afford to pay $30 for a DVD. But in Brazil, $30 is way too much for any average citizen to reasonably afford; so you might sell it there for $5. But what's to stop an American from importing the DVD from Brazil for $5, instead of paying $30 at home? Region codes.\n",

      "gold: When sailing into the wind a yachts sail works exactly like an aeroplanes wing rotated through 90 degrees. What generates the forward momentum is the sideways lift being created by the aerofoil shape of the sail. This is aided by the keel cutting through the water, which helps convert this sideways lift into forward momentum. The sail speed record is currently held by [Sailrocket 2]( URL_0 ) which can sail at about 75 mph in 29 mph winds. This is possible because rather than just being blown along, the boat is powered by the lift its sail generates. Sailing boats can only sail so close to the direction the wind is coming from though. Any closer than about 45 degrees from the wind (less for high tech race yachts) and the sails will stall, stopping the boat in the water.

Electrons can also absorb photons to jump up energy levels - but only if there's the right amount of energy in the photon to do a complete jump.

With light, energy is proportional to the frequency, which is inversely proportional to the wavelength. This means there's a direct relationship between wavelength and energy. This is why glass, for example, is transparent. The amount of energy necessary to excite electrons in glass doesn't match the amount of energy that photons have when they're in the visible part of the spectrum, so the photons go whizzing on through without being absorbed.\n",

If an internal Geiger counter detects radiation, the flask is shattered, releasing the poison that kills the cat.

Yet, when we look in the box, we see the cat either alive or dead, not both alive and dead.

      "--\n",
      "gold: The right joy-con of a Nintendo Switch has a shiny black sensor at the bottom. This sensor, when you point it at stuff, can sense the shape and distance of the stuff. Sort of like a Kinect, if you’ve ever used one of those. Piano: When you slide the right joy-con into the cardboard piano, then pressing keys down on the piano makes other things inside the piano move. The joy-con senses what those things are and, judging by the shapes and positions, the Switch is able to tell which keys are being pressed. The Switch then plays notes that go with those keys, so pressing a cardboard key makes the Switch play the note for that key. The piano is small so it won’t have as many keys as a real piano, but it’s a neat start. RC car: Both joy-cons have a rumble feature, meaning that they can vibrate. Most video game controllers have rumble features now. Most games usually use it to make the controller shake when your guy in the game gets hit, which makes it feel more real. With Labo, you attach the joy-cons to the cardboard RC car and then you press the Switch touchscreen which has touchscreen buttons for left and right. If you press the “left” touchscreen button, the joy-con on the right will shake and that’ll make the car turn left. The RC car won’t have wheels and so it’ll need to be on a flat surface to work. Will it work on carpet? I dunno, I guess we’ll find out.\n",

If you mean something more extreme like enacting laws that blatantly go against the Constitution or cause changes that would alter a branch's power, that could also be done, but it would require an amendment to be passed. An amendment generally requires approval from 2/3 of each house in Congress plus 3/4 of the states. If passed, an amendment can't be rejected by anything other than another amendment and it could even alter the balances between branches.

      "The reason why this is true is because the container is a barrier between the object and the water.  A container is not a barrier to the water, it is a medium that is a good insulator.  When you put something in a container, the water is forced into the container, and the container pushes the water out of the way.  This is why you can't just put a cup of water in a cup and it will float.  You have to put the cup in a small container, which is a lot more dense than the water in the cup.  That means that the water will be forced out of your cup, and you will sink.\n",

Although reading is most definitely an active skill, you don't necessarily read all the words, if the first and last letter are correct in a word, you can change the order of the middle letters and still be able to understand it. That's how we miss typos. For example: I am stitnig at hmoe gvinig emxalpels of wrod rcegointoin. You would have been able to read that (I hope!) despite the many errors in it. This happens because the brain naturally attempts to optimise everything we do. When it comes to reading, it's too much of a task to recognise every combination of words possible, but we know how to spell the words. This means that based on context and a correct spelling, we make educated guesses at what the word is, to speed up the rate at which we read.

In the middle of the 20th century, people thought that white foods were cleaner and therefore healthier. Now, white bread, white rice, and white sugar have been abandoned in favor of brown bread, brown rice, and raw sugar. Peasant foods are now good for you. New science also changes things. As we learn more about how the human body works, we can better judge how food affects the body. Brown fat, for example, did not exist in the imagination in the 19th century, when moderation and bland foods were put forth as better for the body. There are also powerful lobbyists who make their case. Using scientific studies (that they may or may not have funded) they petition to shape how we think about food at the level of public policy.

What happened to that photon? It hit the electron. So really, what is interesting is that when you hit an electron with a photon, it changes the behavior from wave-like to particle-like. Now, it's well established in physics that *any* act of observation requires affecting the observed particle. Ideally we would like to track the path of the electron in a nice dark room without any outside influence, but it's simply impossible to track it in such conditions. It's not the act of observing the electron which changes its behavior. It is the act of manipulating the electron so that we can see the consequences which changes its behavior.

The guitars are heavier, faster, more distorted and sometimes more technical. Again, the vocalists are intense, however, they have more of a growly way of singing, but they're still fairly clean and easy to understand. The lyrical content is often political or controversial in some way. (Jihad by Slayer, Laid to Rest by Lamb of God, Holy Wars... The Punishment is Due by Megadeth) Black metal (from my understanding): A bit slower than Thrash, but more distorted. The vocals are normally squealing and growling in a way that isn't very easy to understand. Lyrical content as far as I know can be fairly Satanic, morbid and dark. Death metal (again, from my understanding): it's like Black metal and Thrash metal had a love child. It has the intensity, and speed of Thrash but the vocals are similar to Black metal. I believe the lyrical content is the same or similar as Black metal as well. Source: I've been a metalhead for 9 going on 10 years. However, I'm more into Thrash, Classic/Heavy Metal and Metalcore.

That one degree means a lot more ice melts, a lot more water evaporates, and increasing pressures cause higher winds. That's part of the reason why calling it \"Climate Change\" has started to replace \"Global Warming\", even though the overall trend would still be warming. It's because these small shifts of 1 degree could vastly effect local climates. A farmland could become a desert, for instance, or a dry area could start to experience severe storms and floods, or prevailing winds and ocean currents could change direction, leading to certain places becoming much colder. But the real worry is that it can have a snowball effect. That 1 degree of temperature can do stuff like melt permafrost or increase ocean acidification, and sometimes release trapped sources of CO2 or Methane, further increasing the greenhouse effect.

      "--\n",
      "gold: Most of the answers here are plain wrong. Actually, you try to have the load as close the the helicopter as possible (within reasonable limits, of course). There are several problems with dangling it far below: * Vibrations can build up in the wire, even to the point where the hook releases (I've seen that happen). * The load becomes a giant pendulum, which takes skill to keep in check, as it tends to have a will of it's own. All manouvres have to be planned further in advance, and done with more precision. * When the load has been dropped, the long wire is a potential hazard if it's not weighted down properly. You don't want it to snap up into the tail rotor. * Maximum speed is lower, due to above problems. * The pilot has a harder time being really accurate when hooking/unhooking, as the load will be further away. Usually, the load is just hanging a meter or two below the helicopter. You want enough clearance so that the cargo won't hit the helicopter, should the weight shift. There are exceptions, of course: * When the circumstances don't allow a short wire. For example, if there are trees or you are building a power line. * When making a movie. It looks more impressive with a long wire. * When the load is large, so that the downwash will push down on the load. For example, some large antennas or building materials. Source: My father was a helicopter pilot, and I often worked with him. Note: I know they usually don't use a wire, but I don't know the proper English word for the nylon loops used. \"Stropp\" in Swedish.\n",

      "The first thing to understand is that the brain is a complex system.  It's not just a bunch of neurons firing at the same time.  There are many different types of neurons, and each type of neuron has a different role in the brain.  The most common type of neurotransmitter is serotonin, which is responsible for mood regulation.  When you take antidepressants, the brain releases a chemical called serotonin, and it makes the neurons firing faster.  This makes the brain more active, and makes the neurotransmitter more available for the brain to use.  \n",

      "Now, the reason why this is important is that it makes it easier for the body to process information.  If you have a depressed brain, the neurotransmitters that make you feel happy are not being used as much, and the brain doesn't have the same amount of serotonin to process it.  So, when you take an antidepressant, the serotonin in the body is being used more, and more efficiently.  That means that the neurotransmotor cortex is being stimulated, and that the neurons are firing faster, and so the brain can process more information.\n",

However, to understand why people have waifus requires a brief explanation of attraction. The generally held consensus is that, first of all, your brain is pattern-seeking. You look at symmetry, ratios, and the like, and you determine that a character is attractive that way. As cold as that sounds, there is another half to this. The other half is personality. What makes someone likable is that they are relatable to you, or you find them interesting in some sort of way. Waifus may display both, but they are obviously not real, tangible people.

      "gold: Cats have some nuances in their behaviour that a lot of humans tend to overlook or misinterpret as lack of affection or being aloof. One thing that a cat will do to display that they are comfortable around you, is look away from you. This lets you know that they do not perceive you as a threat. This is often accompanied by a slow blink where they half close their eyes. If you reciprocate that slow blink and slightly turn your head away, it will show them that you feel the same. If you pick a cat up or approach it in a manner that is very direct, they can interpret this as threatening behaviour. Some cats like to be picked up, some don't. That's kind of dependent on how they were raised. I have a kitten that I'm fostering, and he will come over which I call him with a particular sound or if I make eye-contact and slow-blink. The problem is that a lot of people try to interpret cats in the same way as dogs. Dogs operate a lot like humans in their social structure, which is why we get along so well. For cats, we need to learn to adapt to how they socialise, because our methods do not have as much in common.

Nationalists are more likely to care more about relative gains (gaining 5 more than other countries) where globalists care more about absolute gains (gaining 10 although everyone else gained 11). Most people are somewhere in the middle and not the extremes when it comes to these two world views. You can be for both, ending sweatshops and child labor in other countries but wanting your country to have the largest GDP in the world, etc. Currently, (the last 100 years or so) we are in an age of globalism not seen in any point in human history.

Barbarossa was not the \"start\" of he war for Germany. It was the beginning, middle, and end. They didn't really have the resources to fight beyond that and when Barbarossa failed to topple the Soviet Government, the Germans were doomed. If the Germans knew how strong the Russians really were, they never would have invaded (though they'd still be in a perilous position because every year the Russians would increase their advantage and eventually use that to invade Germany).

      "--\n",
      "gold: I can't exactly explain the science behind night terrors, but I can recount the experience of having them as a very young child. The one that is most memorable happened when I was around 4 or 5 years old. My bed faced a window and it was often the source of strange shadows and lights that scared me before bed. When this particular night terror began I was first jolted awake with a very bright light shining through the window. My eyes opened wide and something like a \"ghost witch\" appeared to be flying towards me through the window. There was loud noises like thunder behind her. I turned away to flee and realized my arms and legs wouldn't move. The feeling you get when a limb falls asleep; that's how my entire body felt. The most intense sense of my limbs having fallen asleep. When I looked at my hands I noticed there were shackles pinning me to the bed. Except they were bright, like electricity. It was as if they were shocking me and that was the feeling in my limbs. I turned back to the window and the witch was now only feet away from me. She was staring right at me and was very bright. I felt like I was going to die. She opened her mouth and let out the most ear piercing screech I have ever heard in my life. I screamed in response and closed my eyes. Moments later my parents rushed in my room. There were other ones I remember. This was the worst and most memorable. It was over 30 years ago, but I remember it vividly. They are truly terrifying. I could not imagine living with them as an adult. Your entire body just goes into overdrive. Everything was bright, loud, painful and I felt like I was going to die the entire time. My understanding is that part of night terrors are accelerated heart beat, pupil dilation, sweating and fear. I don't know if that's what causes everything to be so bright and loud or if your mind is just perceiving these dreams as real and responds to them physically.

This is a major cause of buffering with video streaming, because you're sharing almost the entire length of the connection with many other people. When you watch HD TV over the air, this isn't a concern. Nobody else is using that bandwidth. It's all 100% reserved for the television station. It's a specific frequency range that is legally reserved for them -- so they have all that bandwidth, every hour of the day, every day of the week. Also, it's broadcast, so your TV doesn't have to interact with the source of the transmission -- just pick up the signal and show it.

If democracy works for states, why not companies? Another option might be a centrally planned economy with a democratically elected government. The \"democratically elected\" part is key, because if the people doing the planning aren't held accountable to the workers, then its not really worker control of the means of production.

      "gold: American accents are most variable in terms of vowels, nasality, rhoticism (final R), intervocalic consonants (VCV), and final consonants. You will obviously find greater diversity in places like NYC. The dialect situation in America is very complicated. For example, one of the dialects of New Orleans is the 'yat' dialect, which can trace its ancestry directly to Brooklyn. In general, the **Inland North** is fairly 'standard.' It exhibits the Northern Cities Vowel Shift. The **East** and **Northeast** typically resists merging pin/pen, cot/caught, mary/merry/marry. As a result they have more vowel variation. Some NE dialects are non-rhotic and nasal. You will find larger differences between individual states here. The **Midlands** have some diversity, like in Ohio/Indiana... I'm not familiar with them. The **South** has a good deal of diversity, but most dialects are characterized by the Southern Cities Vowel Shift. Some also have drawls, where an extra schwa vowel (uh) is added after glides. Some dialects have double negatives. Again, there is sometimes non-rhoticism. The **North Central** typically merges the vowels I mentioned resisted by the NE accents. This accent is on the UP of Michigan, and northern WI/MN. They have strong rhotics and unreleased final consonants. \"bag/flag/tag\" are pronounced \"beyg,fleyg,teyg.\" I believe there is a California Vowel Shift as well, but everything west of the Mississippi river is a mystery to me. Some dialects round their lips when pronouncing \"sh\" and \"r\" but I don't know who does/doesn't. **Caveat: Do not confuse vowel sounds with vowel letters. Our alphabet has 5 vowels, but the alphabet is irrelevant. Most Americans have 10-12 vowel phonemes, not counting diphthongs.**\n",

So, the UK has a very different accent than America.  I think that's why the UK is so different from the US (and vice versa).   I'm not saying that the US is different, but it's not like the UK or the UK accents are different.  It's just that the British accents are more pronounced in the UK than the UK's.
